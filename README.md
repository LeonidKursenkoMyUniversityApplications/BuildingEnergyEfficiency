# BuildingEnergyEfficiency
### Information
Master's thesis is a system of modeling the structure and functional content of engineering systems of energy efficient building.
This software product is created for the purpose of master's work and is not intended for commercial use. 
This application was created when I studied at the university in 2018-2019.

C# programming language and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 programming environment were used to develop the appliction. 
A WPF framework was used to develop the GUI. The appliction was designed for use with Windows 10.

The problem of improving the energy efficiency of the building is important for all mankind, 
because it can significantly reduce the cost of heating and electricity, as well as reduce the level of environmental 
pollution by reducing the consumption of fossil resources. In order to evaluate the possibilities of improving the 
energy efficiency of a building, it is necessary to perform modeling of the structure and functional content of 
engineering systems of a building.

The system has a software architecture that consists of three layers: data access layer, business logic layer, 
and presentation layer. 

The level of access to the data is responsible for reading, processing and storing the input data. 
Input processing is necessary to eliminate excess data and automate the process of collecting and calculating statistics. 

The level of business logic performs the construction of models of structure and functional content of engineering systems 
of energy efficient building, makes a forecast for the future. The module analyzes the meteorological data of the region, 
determines the thermal characteristics of the building, the heat demand for heating and domestic hot water supply (DHW) and 
allows users to select the necessary equipment for comfortable and energy-efficient living in the building. 

The View Layer uses a graphical user interface to output the results of the system.

### Functionality of the Application

During the completion of the master's thesis, a system of modeling the structure and functional content 
of engineering systems of energy efficient building, which performs the following functions:
1) processing and conversion of input data; 
2) analysis of meteorological data of the region; 
3) simulation of the electric load schedule; 
4) analysis of the thermal characteristics of the building, the needs for heating energy and DHW; 
5) determining the effectiveness of the installation of a wind power installation for the energy supply of the facility; 
6) determining the efficiency of the installation of an air heat pump for the needs of heating; 
7) determining the efficiency of implementation of the system of heat storage electric heating.

### Usage instruction

After selecting input files, it may take some time to read the files, so wait.
